# Covid-19-Influence-on-Anxiety

In order to understand how Covid-19 breakout affected the anxiety of the population around the globe,
I analyzed Google search queries containing words that express anxiety and relate to the pandemic such as symptom, death, money etc,
in between the dates 01/01-01/06/20 and 01/01-01/06/19. 

Further to that, in order to indicate the difference in anxiety levels between different populations, I used data from 9 different countries,
as well as data from all over the world altogether.

The project and my conclusions can be found in the "Covid19Anxiety" PDF.

This was a final project in the course: "Big Data in Smart Cities". Graded 100.
